## Usage üìù

This is a RESTful API that follows the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It has the following endpoints:

- GET /api/users - returns all the users in the database
- GET /api/users/:id - returns a single user by id
- POST /api/users - creates a new user with the given data
- PUT /api/users/:id - updates an existing user by id with the given data
- DELETE /api/users/:id - deletes an existing user by id

The data for each user should have the following format:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "password": "123456",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

You can use Postman to test the API and see the results.
